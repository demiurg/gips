# GIPS

See http://gipit.github.io/gips/ for documentation, but know it is not
necessarily current.

## Installation

After cloning this git repo & changing to its directory, run `install.sh`,
which only officially supports recent versions of Ubuntu.  It will use `sudo`
to install system packages, and may ask for authentication accordingly.  It
runs apt-get, which may prompt you for confirmation of its actions.

To permit automated testing, create a file named `pytest.ini` in the project
directory, and use it to set the `data-repo` and `output-dir` settings to full
paths to the respective directories.


```
[pytest]
# GIPS' configured data repository:
data-repo = /home/your-user-name-here/src/gips/data-repo
# a directory of your choice, used for output from, e.g., gips_project
output-dir = /home/your-user-name-here/src/gips/testout
# These should remain as they are (placing them in a config file is a TODO):
python_functions =  t_ test_
python_files =      t_*.py test_*.py
```

## Running Automated tests

The test suite is based on pytest:  https://pytest.org/latest/contents.html

```
#!bash
# to run all tests (after activating your virtualenv):
py.test --setup-repo # only needed for the first run
py.test --clear-repo # destroy and recreate the repo if it's in a bad state
py.test              # save time without --setup-repo
py.test -s           # echo stdout & stderr to console (not shown by default)
```

Select specific tests per usual for pytest:

https://pytest.org/latest/usage.html#specifying-tests-selecting-tests

You can also select tests based on mark (marks are tags for tests):

https://pytest.org/latest/example/markers.html

If you specify the same test file multiple times on the command line (say, to
specify multiple tests in that file), any module-scoped test fixtures will run
once for each time the file is listed, which may not be what was expected.
This is because pytest sees each item on the command line as a separate run of
the module, even though really it's the same file listed mulitple times.
Instead, avoid the problem by using `-k` to specify tests.
